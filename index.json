On account of the streaming nature of socialmessages, incremental social event detection models in acquiring, preserving, and updating messages over time have attracted greatattention. However, the challenge is that the existing event detection methods towards streaming social messages are generallyconfronted with ambiguous events features, dispersive text contents, and multiple languages, and hence result in low accuracy andgeneralization ability. In this paper, we present a novel reinForced,incremental and cross-lingual socialEventdetection architecture,namelyFinEvent, from streaming social messages. Concretely, we first model social messages into heterogeneous graphs integratingboth rich meta-semantics and diverse meta-relations, and convert them to weighted multi-relational message graphs. Secondly, wepropose a new reinforced weighted multi-relational graph neural network framework by using a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learningalgorithm to select optimal aggregation thresholds across different relations/edges to learn social message embeddings. To solve thelong-tail problem in social event detection, a balanced sampling strategy guided Contrastive Learning mechanism is designed forincremental social message representation learning. Thirdly, a new Deep Reinforcement Learning guided density-based spatialclustering model is designed to select the optimal minimum number of samples required to form a cluster and optimal minimumdistance between two clusters in social event detection tasks. Finally, we implement incremental social message representationlearning based on knowledge preservation on the graph neural network and achieve the transferring cross-lingual social eventdetection. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate theFinEventon Twitter streams, demonstrating a significant and consistentimprovement in model quality with 14%-118%, 8%-170%, and 2%-21% increases in performance on offline, online, and cross-lingualsocial event detection tasks.","tags":["graph neural networks","social event detection"],"title":"Reinforced, Incremental and Cross-lingual Event Detection From Social Messages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongran Yu","Bo Yang","Shirui Pan","Anchen Li","Qianhao Wei"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656455777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656455777,"objectID":"ecbec89c52062567e09fbf73d8848f47","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/cvpr-22-yu/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T09:36:17+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cvpr-22-yu/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to leverage symbolic knowledge to improve the performance and interpretability of the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) models. Existing VRD methods based on deep learning suffer from the problems of poor performance on insufficient labeled examples and lack of interpretability. To overcome the aforementioned weaknesses, we integrate symbolic knowledge into deep learning models and propose a bi-level probabilistic graphical reasoning framework called BPGR. Specifically, in the high-level structure, we take the objects and relationships detected by the VRD model as hidden variables (reasoning results); In the low-level structure of BPGR, we use Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) to project First-Order Logic (FOL) as observed variables (symbolic knowledge) to correct error reasoning results. We adopt a variational EM algorithm for optimization. Experiments results show that our BPGR improves the performance of the VRD models. In particular, BPGR can also provide easy-to-understand insights for reasoning results to show interpretability.","tags":["visual reasoning"],"title":"A Probabilistic Graphical Model Based on Neural-symbolic Reasoning for Visual Relationship Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miao Zhang","Shirui Pan","Xiaojun Chang","Steven Su","Jilin Hu","Reza Haffari","Bin Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656455777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656455777,"objectID":"de529fad9e4564e98f250ebfe87fc694","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/cvpr-22-zhang/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T09:36:17+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cvpr-22-zhang/","section":"publication","summary":"Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has received massive attention in recent years, mainly because it significantly reduces the computational cost through weight sharing and continuous relaxation. However, more recent works find that existing differentiable NAS techniques struggle to outperform naive baselines, yielding deteriorative architectures as the search proceeds. Rather than directly optimizing the architecture parameters, this paper formulates the neural architecture search as a distribution learning problem through relaxing the architecture weights into Gaussian distributions. By leveraging the natural-gradient variational inference (NGVI), the architecture distribution can be easily optimized based on existing codebases without incurring more memory and computational consumption. We demonstrate how the differentiable NAS benefits from Bayesian principles, enhancing exploration and improving stability. The experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1Shot1 benchmark datasets confirm the significant improvements the proposed framework can make. In addition, instead of simply applying the argmax on the learned parameters, we further leverage the recently-proposed training-free proxies in NAS to select the optimal architecture from a group architectures drawn from the optimized distribution, where we achieve competitive results on the NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1Shot1 benchmarks. Our best architecture in the DARTS search space also obtains competitive test errors with 2.37%, 15.72%, and 24.2% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively.","tags":["medical report generation","graph transformer"],"title":"BaLeNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search via Bayesian Learning Rule","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingjie Li","Wenjia Cai","Karin Verspoor","Shirui Pan","Xiaodan Li","Xiaojun Chang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656455777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656455777,"objectID":"d5283b9d9209d5941d70f449b812f6d6","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/cvpr-22-li/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T09:36:17+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cvpr-22-li/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic generation of ophthalmic reports using data-driven neural networks has great potential in clinical practice. When writing a report, ophthalmologists make inferences with prior clinical knowledge. This knowledge has been neglected in prior medical report generation methods. To endow models with the capability of incorporating expert knowledge, we propose a Cross-modal clinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG), in which clinical relation triples are injected into the visual features as prior knowledge to drive the decoding procedure. However, two major common Knowledge Noise (KN) issues may affect models' effectiveness. 1) Existing general biomedical knowledge bases such as the UMLS may not align meaningfully to the specific context and language of the report, limiting their utility for knowledge injection. 2) Incorporating too much knowledge may divert the visual features from their correct meaning. To overcome these limitations, we design an automatic information extraction scheme based on natural language processing to obtain clinical entities and relations directly from in-domain training reports. Given a set of ophthalmic images, our CGT first restores a sub-graph from the clinical graph and injects the restored triples into visual features. Then visible matrix is employed during the encoding procedure to limit the impact of knowledge. Finally, reports are predicted by the encoded cross-modal features via a Transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on the large-scale FFA-IR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CGT is able to outperform previous benchmark methods and achieve state-of-the-art performances.","tags":["medical report generation","graph transformer"],"title":"Cross-modal Clinical Graph Transformer For Ophthalmic Report Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bang Wu","Xiangwen Yang","Shirui Pan","Xingliang Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1653899883,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653899883,"objectID":"ad845989dbcd6880f3723d93084c0fdf","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/asiaccs-22-wu/","publishdate":"2021-10-18T19:38:03+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/asiaccs-22-wu/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine learning models are shown to face a severe threat from Model Extraction Attacks, where a well-trained private model owned by a service provider can be stolen by an attacker pretending as a client.

In this paper, for the first time, we comprehensively investigate and develop model extraction attacks against GNN models. We first systematically formalise the threat modelling in the context of GNN model extraction and classify the adversarial threats into seven categories by considering different background knowledge of the attacker, e.g., attributes and/or neighbour connections of the nodes obtained by the attacker. Then we present detailed methods which utilise the accessible knowledge in each threat to implement the attacks.

Before such a promotion, it is important to predict potential best sellers and their respective sales volumes, so that the platform can arrange their supply chains and logistics accordingly. For items with a sufficiently long sales history, accurate sales forecast can be achieved through the traditional statistical forecasting techniques. To accurately predict the sales volume of a new item, however, is rather challenging with existing methods: time series models tend to overfit due to the very limited historical sales records of the new item, whereas models that do not utilize historical information often fail to make accurate predictions, due to the lack of strong indicators of sales volume among the item’s basic attributes. This paper presents the solution deployed at Alibaba in 2019, which had been used in production to prepare for its annual “Double 11” promotion event whose total sales amount exceeded 38 billion US dollars in a single day. The main idea of the proposed solution is to predict the sales volume of each new item through its connections with older products with sufficiently long sales history. In other words, our solution takes into account the cross-selling effects between different products, which has been largely neglected in previous methods. Specifically, the proposed solution first constructs an item graph, in which each new item is connected to relevant older items. Then, a novel multi-task graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is trained by a multi-objective optimization based gradient surgery technique to predict the expected sales volumes of new items. The designs of both the item graph and the GCN exploit the fact that we only need to perform accurate sales forecasts for potential best-selling items in a major promotion, which helps reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments on both proprietary AliExpress data and a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves consistent performance gains compared to existing methods for sales forecast.","tags":["graph neural networks"],"title":"Predicting Best-Selling New Products in a Major Promotion Campaign through Graph Convolutional Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongwon Ryu","Ehsan Shareghi","Meng Fang","Yunqiu Xu","Shirui Pan","Reza Haffari"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1653604577,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653604577,"objectID":"f7181152f9b056eb6df12b2ccf206ef9","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/acl-22-ryu/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T09:36:17+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acl-22-ryu/","section":"publication","summary":"Text-based games (TGs) are exciting testbeds for developing deep reinforcement learning techniques due to their partially observed environments and large action spaces.

To date, most GCNs are designed for a single domain (graph) and therefore incapable of transferring knowledge from/to different domains (graphs), due to the inherent challenges in both graph representation learning and domain adaptation across graph domains. This paper proposes a novel Graph Contrastive Learning Network (GCLN) for unsupervised domain adaptive graph learning. The key innovation is to enforce attraction and repulsion forces within each single graph domain, and across two graph domains. Within each graph, an attraction force encourages local patch node features to be similar to global representation of the entire graph, whereas a repulsion force will repel node features so they can separate network from its permutations (i.e.  domain-specific graph contrastive learning). Across two graph domains, an attraction force encourages node features from two domains to be largely consistent, whereas a repulsion force ensures features are discriminative to differentiate graph domains (i.e. cross-domain graph contrastive learning). The within- and cross-domain graph contrastive learning is carried out by optimizing an objective function, which combines source classifier loss, domain classifier loss, target classifier loss, domain-specific contrastive loss, and cross-domain contrastive loss. As a result, feature learning from graphs are facilitated using knowledge transferred between graphs.

Graph contrastive learning is one of the unsupervised graph representation learning methods, which recently attracts attention from researchers and has achieved state-of-the-art performances on various tasks. The key to the success of graph contrastive learning is to construct proper contrasting pairs to acquire the underlying structural semantics of the graph. However, this key part is not fully explored currently, most of the ways to generate contrasting pairs focus on augmenting or perturbating graph structures to obtain different views of the input graph. But such strategies could degrade the performances via adding noise into the graph, which may narrow down the field of the applications of graph contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, namely Dual Space Graph Contrastive (DSGC) Learning, to conduct graph contrastive learning among views generated in different spaces including the hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. Since both spaces have their own advantages to represent graph data in the embedding spaces, we hope to utilize graph contrastive learning to bridge the spaces and leverage advantages from both sides. The comparison experiment results show that DSGC achieves competitive or better performances among all the datasets. Plus, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of different graph encoders on DSGC, giving insights about how to better leverage the advantages of contrastive learning between different spaces.","tags":["graph neural networks"],"title":"Dual Space Graph Contrastive Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu","Yu Zheng","Daokun Zhang","Hongxu Chen","Hao Peng","Shirui Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1650839777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650839777,"objectID":"8204e0fd77ef8e965275a61887bfffcf","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/www-22-liu/","publishdate":"2022-01-14T09:36:17+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/www-22-liu/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a successful tool in a variety of graph-related applications. However, the performance of GNNs can be deteriorated when noisy connections occur in the original graph structures; besides, the dependence on explicit structures prevents GNNs from being applied to general unstructured scenarios. To address these issues, recently emerged deep graph structure learning (GSL) methods propose to jointly optimize the graph structure along with GNN under the supervision of a node classification task. Nonetheless, these methods focus on a supervised learning scenario, which leads to several problems, i.e., the reliance on labels, the bias of edge distribution, and the limitation on application tasks. In this paper, we propose a more practical GSL paradigm, unsupervised graph structure learning, where the learned graph topology is optimized by data itself without any external guidance (i.e., labels). To solve the unsupervised GSL problem, we propose a novel StrUcture Bootstrapping contrastive LearnIng fraMEwork (SUBLIME for abbreviation) with the aid of self-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we generate a learning target from the original data as an “anchor graph”, and use a contrastive loss to maximize the agreement between the anchor graph and the learned graph. To provide persistent guidance, we design a novel bootstrapping mechanism that upgrades the anchor graph with learned structures during model learning. We also design a series of graph learners and post-processing schemes to model the structures to learn. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our proposed SUBLIME and high quality of the optimized graphs.","tags":["graph neural networks"],"title":"Towards Unsupervised Deep Graph Structure Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"潘世瑞，澳大利亚基金委杰出青年 ARC Future Fellow （2021年全澳信息学部仅5人入选）。现任蒙纳士大学（Monash University）数据科学与人工智能系高级讲师（相当于北美副教授），人工智能研究生主任。连续两年入选全球AAAI/IJCAI最具影响力学者（2022澳洲仅3人入选），获得2021蒙纳士大学信息技术学院研究卓越奖（早期研究者）。指导学生获得数据挖掘会议ICDM 最佳学生论文奖（2020），获得2020年JCDL会议最佳论文提名奖。在NeurIPS、ICML、KDD、TPAMI、TKDE等发表高水平论文150篇。同时担任TPAMI, TNNLS, TKDE, TCYB等领域期刊审稿人，任IJCAI, AAAI, KDD, WWW, CVPR 等（高级）程序委员会委员。谷歌学术引用8500次。主要研究方向为数据挖掘、机器学习，侧重于图数据学习与分析。过去3年其研究受到澳大利亚基金委（Australian Research Council)， 澳大利亚国防科技部（Defence Science and Technology Group），美卓奥图泰 (Metso Outotec)等资助，累计金额170万澳元。\n潘世瑞长期从事图数据挖掘与学习研究，其领导的实验室GRAND Lab  包括博士后博士生近20人，是澳大利亚最大的专注于图机器学习的实验室。根据Google Scholar (2021/12)， 潘世瑞是图神经网络方向全球十大学者之一（澳洲第一）。在图神经网络及其在异常检测、推荐系统、时序分析、知识图谱等方面进行了广泛研究。研究工作受到国际同行学者广泛关注，其关于图神经网络的综述文章《A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks》发表于IEEE TNNLS 2021， 引用高达3000+。发表于KDD, IJCAI, AAAI, CIKM等顶级会议的共7篇文章被评为最具影响力论文（Most Influential Papers）。\n","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646611200,"objectID":"16e314dd94b5b1559c8d0dbadffa562b","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/post/bio_cn/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bio_cn/","section":"post","summary":"潘世瑞，澳大利亚基金委杰出青年 ARC Future Fellow （2021年全澳信息学部仅5人入选）。现任蒙纳士大学（Monash University）数据科学与人工智能系高级讲师（相当于北美副教授），人工智能研究生主任。连续两年入选全球AAAI/IJCAI最具影响力学者（2022澳洲仅3人入选），获得2021蒙纳士大学信息技术学院研究卓越奖（早期研究者）。指导学生获得数据挖掘会议ICDM 最佳学生论文奖（2020），获得2020年JCDL会议最佳论文提名奖。在NeurIPS、ICML、KDD、TPAMI、TKDE等发表高水平论文150篇。同时担任TPAMI, TNNLS, TKDE, TCYB等领域期刊审稿人，任IJCAI, AAAI, KDD, WWW, CVPR 等（高级）程序委员会委员。谷歌学术引用8500次。主要研究方向为数据挖掘、机器学习，侧重于图数据学习与分析。过去3年其研究受到澳大利亚基金委（Australian Research Council)， 澳大利亚国防科技部（Defence Science and Technology Group），美卓奥图泰 (Metso Outotec)等资助，累计金额170万澳元。\n潘世瑞长期从事图数据挖掘与学习研究，其领导的实验室GRAND Lab  包括博士后博士生近20人，是澳大利亚最大的专注于图机器学习的实验室。根据Google Scholar (2021/12)， 潘世瑞是图神经网络方向全球十大学者之一（澳洲第一）。在图神经网络及其在异常检测、推荐系统、时序分析、知识图谱等方面进行了广泛研究。研究工作受到国际同行学者广泛关注，其关于图神经网络的综述文章《A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks》发表于IEEE TNNLS 2021， 引用高达3000+。发表于KDD, IJCAI, AAAI, CIKM等顶级会议的共7篇文章被评为最具影响力论文（Most Influential Papers）。","tags":null,"title":"潘世瑞（中文简介）","type":"post"},{"authors":["Weizhen Dang","Haibo Wang","Shirui Pan","Pei Zhang","Chuan Zhou","Xin Chen","Jilong Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1645951656,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645951656,"objectID":"19ae4c187e75aa2716516e859c63e9b5","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/wsdm-21-dang/","publishdate":"2021-10-22T19:47:36+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wsdm-21-dang/","section":"publication","summary":"Human mobility prediction is of great importance for various applications such as smart transportation and personalized recommender systems.

But these methods ignore the more general relational semantics underlying all the known triples that can provide richer information to represent emerging entities so as to satisfy the inductive scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel model called CFAG, which utilizes two granularity levels of relational semantics in a coarse-grained aggregator (CG-AGG) and a fine-grained generative adversarial net (FG-GAN), for inductive KGC. The CG-AGG firstly generates entity representations with multiple semantics through a hypergraph neural network-based global aggregator and a graph neural network-based local aggregator, and the FG-GAN further enhances entity representations with specific semantics through conditional generative adversarial nets.

However, existing attributed graph embedding models are designed in continuous Euclidean spaces which often introduce data redundancy and impose challenges to storage and computation costs. In this paper, we study a new problem of discrete embedding for attributed graphs that can learn succinct node representations.

Most existing works focus on aggregating users’ interests within the group to learn group preference. These methods are faced with two problems. First, these methods only model the user preference inside a single group while ignoring the collaborative relations among users and items across different groups. Second, they assume that group preference is an aggregation of user interests, and factually a group may pursue some targets not derived from users’ interests. Thus they are insufficient to model the general group preferences which are independent of existing user interests. To address the above issues, we propose a novel dual channel Hypergraph Convolutional network for group Recommendation (HCR), which consists of member-level preference network and group-level preference network. In the member-level preference network, in order to capture cross-group collaborative connections among users and items, we devise a member-level hypergraph convolutional network to learn group members’ personal preferences. In the group-level preference network, the group’s general preference is captured by a group-level graph convolutional network based on group similarity. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets and the experimental results show that the proposed model significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art group recommendation techniques.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks","Recommender Systems"],"title":"Hypergraph Convolutional Network for Group Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soheila Molaei","Nima Bousejin","Hadi Zare","Mahdi Jalili","Shirui Pan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628640000,"objectID":"d4d17ab322b145ae6e49bfb86f242d3f","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/molaei-tnnls-21/","publishdate":"2021-08-11T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/molaei-tnnls-21/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-Euclidean property of graph structures has faced interesting challenges when deep learning methods are applied.

Specifically, we observe that the current evasion attacks suffer from two limitations: (1) the attack strategy based on the reinforcement learning method might not be transferable when the attack budget changes; (2) the greedy mechanism in the vanilla gradient-based method ignores the long-term benefits of each perturbation operation. In this paper, we propose a new attack method named projective ranking to overcome the above limitations. Our idea is to learn a powerful attack strategy considering the long-term benefits of perturbations, then adjust it as little as possible to generate adversarial samples under different budgets. We further employ mutual information to measure the long-term benefits of each perturbation and rank them accordingly, so the learned attack strategy has better attack performance. Our method dramatically reduces the adaptation cost of learning a new attack strategy by projecting the attack strategy when the attack budget changes. Our preliminary evaluation results in synthesized and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method owns powerful attack performance and effective transferability.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks","Adversarial Attacks"],"title":"Projective Ranking: A Transferable Evasion Attack Method on Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chun Wang","Shirui Pan","Celina P Yu","Ruiqi Hu","Guodong Long","Chengqi Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628121600,"objectID":"48a85c5d9c4d549dc76f9ac2e04a309f","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/pr-wang-21/","publishdate":"2021-08-05T12:15:49.436331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pr-wang-21/","section":"publication","summary":"Node clustering aims to partition the vertices in a graph into multiple groups or communities.

In this paper, we propose a clustering-directed deep learning approach, Deep Neighbor-aware Embedded Node Clustering (DNENC for short) for clustering graph data. Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. It encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph into a compact representation via a neighbor-aware graph autoencoder, which progressively absorbs information from neighbors via a convolutional or attentional encoder. Multiple neighbor-aware encoders are stacked to build a deep architecture followed by an inner-product decoder for reconstructing the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels are generated to supervise a self-training process, which iteratively refines the node clustering results. The self-training process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding in a unified framework, to benefit both components mutually.

We analyze that an alternative method, the label propagation algorithm (LPA), avoids the aforementioned problems thus it is a promising choice for graph semi-supervised learning. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of LPA on feature exploitation and relation modeling make propagating labels become less effective. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework for graph semi-supervised learning termed as Cyclic Label Propagation (CycProp for abbreviation), which integrates GNNs into the process of label propagation in a cyclic and mutually reinforcing manner to exploit the advantages of both GNNs and LPA. In particular, our proposed CycProp updates the node embeddings learned by GNN module with the augmented information by label propagation, while fine-tunes the weighted graph of label propagation with the help of node embedding in turn. After the model converges, reliably predicted labels and informative node embeddings are obtained with the LPA and GNN modules respectively. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted, and the experimental results empirically demonstrate that the proposed CycProp model can achieve relatively significant gains over the state-of-the-art methods.","tags":["Graph neural networks"],"title":"Cyclic label propagation for graph semi-supervised learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Man Wu","Shirui Pan","Xingquan Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623413749,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623413749,"objectID":"9c287a34acd3c41c1bf78ed699ea6a82","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/kais-wu-21/","publishdate":"2021-06-11T12:15:49.436331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kais-wu-21/","section":"publication","summary":"Graph learning, such as node classification, is typically carried out in a closed-world setting. A number of nodes are labeled, and the learning goal is to correctly classify remaining (unlabeled) nodes into classes, represented by the labeled nodes. In reality, due to limited labeling capability or dynamic evolving nature of networks, some nodes in the networks may not belong to any existing/seen classes, and therefore cannot be correctly classified by closed-world learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new open-world graph learning paradigm, where the learning goal is to correctly classy nodes belonging to labeled classes into correct categories, and also classify nodes not belonging to labeled classes to an unseen class. Open-world graph learning has three major challenges: (1) graphs do not have features to represent nodes for learning; (2) unseen class nodes do not have labels, and may exist in an arbitrary form different from labeled classes; and (3) graph learning should differentiate whether a node  belong to an existing/seen class or an unseen class. To tackle the challenges, we propose an uncertain node representation learning principle to use multiple versions of node feature representation to test a classifier's response on a node, through which we can differentiate whether a node belongs to the unseen class. Technical wise, we propose constrained variational graph autoencoder, using label loss and class uncertainty loss constraints, to ensure that node representation learning is sensitive to the unseen class. As a result, node embedding features are denoted by distributions, instead of deterministic feature vectors. In order to test the certainty of a node belonging to seen classes, a sampling process is proposed to generate multiple versions of feature vectors to represent each node, using automatic thresholding to reject nodes not belonging to seen classes as unseen class nodes. Experiments, using graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks on four real-world networks, demonstrate the algorithm performance. Case studies and ablation analysis also show the advantage of the uncertain representation learning and automatic threshold selection for open-world graph learning.

Compared with methods on static networks, temporal network embedding methods are facing three challenges: 1) it cannot describe the temporal dependency across network snapshots, 2) the node embedding in the latent space fails to indicate changes in the network topology and 3) it cannot avoid a lot of redundant computation via parameter inheritance on a series of snapshots. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel temporal network embedding method named TVAE, which is based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to capture the evolution of temporal networks for link prediction. It not only generates low-dimensional embedding vectors of nodes, but also preserves the dynamic non-linear features of temporal networks. Through the combination of a self-attention mechanism and recurrent neural network, the proposed TVAE can update node representations while keeping the temporal dependency of vectors over time. We utilize parameter inheritance to keep the new embedding close to the previous one, rather than explicitly using regularization, thus it is effective for large-scale networks. We evaluate our model and several baselines on synthetic datasets and real-world networks.

A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop optimisation.

To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that the architecture optimization with the proposed method is expected to converge to a stationary point.

As a result, their performances can be limited, particularly in the regions with diverse land cover appearances. In this paper, we develop a new Dual Interactive GCN (DIGCN) which introduces the dual GCN branches to capture spatial information at different scales. More significantly, the dual interactive module is embedded across the GCN branches, so that the correlation of multi-scale spatial information can be leveraged to refine the graph information. To be concrete, the edge information contained in one GCN branch can be refined by incorporating the feature representations from the other branch. Analogously, improved feature representations can be generated in one GCN branch by fusing the edge information from the other branch. As such, the refined graph information can help enhance the representation power of the model. Furthermore, to avoid the negative effects of the manually constructed graph, our proposed model adaptively learns a discriminative region-induced graph, which also accelerates the convolution operation. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method on four commonly used HSI benchmark datasets, and state-of-the-art results can be achieved when compared with several typical HSI classification methods.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Dual Interactive Graph Convolutional Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yizhen Zheng","Vincent C.

Graph learning has proved to be effective for many tasks, such as classification, link prediction, recommender systems, and anomaly detection. Generally, graph learning methods extract relevant features of graphs by taking advantage of machine learning algorithms. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview on the state of the art of graph learning. In particular, special attention is paid to four categories of existing graph learning methods, including graph signal processing, matrix factorization, random walk, and deep learning.

Recently, the deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have shown promising results over shallow approaches, especially on networks with high-dimensional attributes and complex structures. However, existing approaches, which employ graph autoencoder as their backbone, do not fully exploit the rich information of the network, resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, these methods do not directly target anomaly detection in their learning objective and fail to scale to large networks due to the full graph training mechanism. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a novel Contrastive self-supervised Learning framework for Anomaly detection on attributed networks (CoLA for abbreviation). Our framework fully exploits the local information from network data by sampling a novel type of contrastive instance pair, which can capture the relationship between each node and its neighboring substructure in an unsupervised way. Meanwhile, a well-designed graph neural network-based contrastive learning model is proposed to learn informative embedding from high-dimensional attributes and local structure and measure the agreement of each instance pairs with its outputted scores. The multi-round predicted scores by the contrastive learning model are further used to evaluate the abnormality of each node with statistical estimation. In this way, the learning model is trained by a specific anomaly detection-aware target. Furthermore, since the input of the graph neural network module is batches of instance pairs instead of the full network, our framework can adapt to large networks flexibly. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on all seven benchmark datasets.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks","Anomaly Detection"],"title":"Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks via Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miao Zhang","Huiqi Li","Shirui Pan","Juan Lyu","Steve Ling","Steven Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613347200,"objectID":"97a8fd2ecc8cb46fd23c4614ba3d89db","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tevc-21-zhang/","publishdate":"2020-02-15T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tevc-21-zhang/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates deep neural networks (DNNs) based lung nodule classification with hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameter optimization in DNNs is a computationally expensive problem, and a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm has been recently introduced to automatically search for optimal hyperparameter configurations of DNNs, by applying computationally efficient surrogate models to approximate the validation error function of hyperparameter configurations. Different from existing surrogate models adopting stationary covariance functions (kernels) to measure the difference between hyperparameter points, this paper proposes a non-stationary kernel that allows the surrogate model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the spatial location of inputs. A multi-level convolutional neural network (ML-CNN) is built for lung nodule classification, and the hyperparameter configuration is optimized by the proposed non-stationary kernel-based Gaussian surrogate model. Our algorithm searches with a surrogate for optimal setting via a hyperparameter importance based evolutionary strategy, and the experiments demonstrate our algorithm outperforms manual tuning and several well-established hyperparameter optimization methods, including random search, grid Search, the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Approach (TPE), Gaussian processes (GP) with stationary kernels, and the recently proposed Hyperparameter Optimization via RBF and Dynamic coordinate search (HORD).","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Convolutional Neural Networks based Lung Nodule Classification: A Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Man Wu","Shirui Pan","Lan Du","Xingquan Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612656000,"objectID":"59c3f98ba84f2c036d5d31b547d09724","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tkdd-21-wu/","publishdate":"2020-02-07T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tkdd-21-wu/","section":"publication","summary":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are important tools for transductive learning tasks, such as node classification in graphs, due to their expressive power in capturing complex interdependency between nodes. To enable graph neural network learning, existing works typically assume that labeled nodes, from two or multiple classes, are provided, so that a discriminative classifier can be learned from the labeled data. In reality, this assumption might be too restrictive for applications, as users may only provide labels of interest in a single class for a small number of nodes. In addition, most GNN models only aggregate information from short distances (e.g., 1-hop neighbors) in each round, and fail to capture long distance relationship in graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network framework, long-short distance aggregation networks (LSDAN), to overcome these limitations. By generating multiple graphs at different distance levels, based on the adjacency matrix, we develop a long-short distance attention model to model these graphs. The direct neighbors are captured via a short-distance attention mechanism, and neighbors with long distance are captured by a long distance attention mechanism. Two novel risk estimators are further employed to aggregate long- short-distance networks, for PU learning and the loss is back-propagated for model learning.

Recent studies seek to address this challenge from the perspective of meta learning, and most of them follow a manner of parameter initialization, where the model parameters can be learned by a few steps of gradient updates. While these gradient-based meta-learning models achieve promising performances to some extent, a fundamental problem of them is how to adapt the global knowledge learned from previous tasks for the recommendations of cold-start users more effectively. In this paper, we develop a novel meta-learning recommender called task-adaptive neural process (TaNP). TaNP is a new member of the neural process family, where making recommendations for each user is associated with a corresponding stochastic process. TaNP directly maps the observed interactions of each user to a predictive distribution, sidestepping some training issues in gradient-based meta-learning models. More importantly, to balance the trade-off between model capacity and adaptation reliability, we introduce a novel task-adaptive mechanism. It enables our model to learn the relevance of different tasks and customize the global knowledge to the task-related decoder parameters for estimating user preferences. We validate TaNP on multiple benchmark datasets in different experimental settings.

As one of the most popular graph-based SSL approaches, the recently proposed Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained remarkable progress by combining the sound expressiveness of neural networks with graph structure. Nevertheless, the existing graph-based methods do not directly address the core problem of SSL, ie, the shortage of supervision, and thus their performances are still very limited. To accommodate this issue, a novel GCN-based SSL algorithm is presented in this paper to enrich the supervision signals by utilizing both data similarities and graph structure. Firstly, by designing a semi-supervised contrastive loss, improved node representations can be generated via maximizing the agreement between different views of the same data or the data from the same class. Therefore, the rich unlabeled data and the scarce yet valuable labeled data can jointly provide abundant supervision information for learning discriminative node representations, which helps improve the subsequent classification result. Secondly, the underlying determinative relationship between the data features and input graph topology is extracted as supplementary supervision signals for SSL via using a graph generative loss related to the input features. Intensive experimental results on a variety of real-world datasets firmly verify the effectiveness of our algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","tags":["Contrastive Learning","Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Contrastive and Generative Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liang Wang","Zhiwen Yu","Qi Han","Dingqi Yang","Shirui Pan","Yuan Yao","Daqing Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605225600,"objectID":"1f2f08fc17e6c057f1e921b10d12beaa","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tmc-20-wang/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tmc-20-wang/","section":"publication","summary":"With the proliferation of increasingly powerful mobile devices and wireless networks, mobile crowdsourcing has emerged as a novel service paradigm.

However, the supernet training paradigm in one-shot NAS introduces catastrophic forgetting, where each step of the training can deteriorate the performance of other architectures that contain partially-shared weights with current architecture. To overcome this problem of catastrophic forgetting, we formulate supernet training for one-shot NAS as a constrained continual learning optimization problem such that learning the current architecture does not degrade the validation accuracy of previous architectures. The key to solving this constrained optimization problem is a novelty search based architecture selection (NSAS) loss function that regularizes the supernet training by using a greedy novelty search method to find the most representative subset. We applied the NSAS loss function to two one-shot NAS baselines and extensively tested them on both a common search space and a NAS benchmark dataset. We further derive three variants based on the NSAS loss function, the NSAS with depth constrain (NSAS-C) to improve  the transferability, and NSAS-G and NSAS-LG to handle the situation with a limited number of constraints. The experiments on the common NAS search space demonstrate that NSAS and it variants improve the predictive ability of supernet training in one-shot NAS with remarkable and efficient performance on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets.

Differently, this paper utilizes a variational graph autoencoder to injectively transform the discrete architecture space into an equivalently continuous latent space, to resolve the incongruence. A probabilistic exploration enhancement method is accordingly devised to encourage intelligent exploration during the architecture search in the latent space, to avoid local optimal in architecture search. As the catastrophic forgetting in differentiable One-Shot NAS deteriorates supernet predictive ability and makes the bilevel optimization inefficient, this paper further proposes an architecture complementation method to relieve this deficiency.

Most recent graph embedding methods focus on attributed graphs, since they preserve both structure and content information in the network. However, corruption can exist in the graph structure as well as the node content of the graph, and both can lead to inferior embedding results. Unfortunately, few existing graph embedding algorithms have considered the corruption problem, and to the best of our knowledge, none has studied structural corruption in attributed graphs, including missing and redundant edges. This field is difficult for previous methods, mainly due to two challenges: (1) the existence of various corruption causes has made it difficult to recognize corruptions in graphs, and (2) the complexity of graph-structured data has increased the difficulty of handling corruption therein for graph embedding methods. These facts lead us here to propose a novel autoencoder-based graph embedding approach, which is robust against structural corruption. Our idea comes from the recent discovery of memorization effects in deep learning. Namely, deep neural networks prefer to fit clean data first, before they over-fit corrupted data. Specifically, we train two autoencoders simultaneously and let them learn the reliability of the edges in the graph from each other. The two autoencoders would evaluate the edges according to their reconstructed structure and manipulate this by devaluing those distrusted edges to update the structure information. The updated structure would be used further in the next iteration as the ground-truth of its peer-network. Experiments on different versions of real-world graphs show state-of-the-art results and demonstrate the robustness of our model against structural corruption.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Cross-Graph: Robust and Unsupervised Embedding for Attributed Graphs with Corrupted Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Man Wu","Shirui Pan","Xingquan Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"4eece83da8481138bb874419b8f01de2","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/icdm-20-wu/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icdm-20-wu/","section":"publication","summary":"In traditional graph learning tasks, such as node classification, the learning is carried out in a closed-world setting where the number of classes and their training samples are provided to help train models, and the learning goal is to correctly classify unlabeled nodes into classes already known. In reality, due to limited labeling capability and dynamic evolving of networks, some nodes in the networks may not belong to any existing/seen classes, and therefore cannot be correctly classified by closed-world learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new open-world graph learning paradigm, where the learning goal is to not only classify nodes belonging to seen classes into correct groups, but also classify nodes not belonging to existing classes to an unseen class. The essential challenge of the open-world graph learning is that (1) unseen class has no labeled samples, and may exist in an arbitrary form different from existing seen classes; and (2) both graph feature learning and prediction should differentiate whether a node may belong to an existing/seen class or an unseen class. To tackle the challenges, we propose an uncertain node representation learning approach, using constrained variational graph autoencoder networks, where the label loss and class uncertainty loss constraints are used to ensure that the node representation learning are sensitive to unseen class. As a result, the node embedding features are denoted by distributions, instead of deterministic feature vectors. By using a sampling process to generate multiple versions of feature vectors, we are able to test the certainty of a node belonging to seen classes, and automatically determine a threshold to reject nodes not belonging to seen classes as unseen class nodes. Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the algorithm performance, comparing to baselines.

A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it's fair to say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated.

However, state-of-the art video event understanding approaches remain very limited in terms of their ability to deal with data sparsity, semantically unrepresentative event names, and lack of coherence between visual and textual concepts. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a method of grounding visual concepts for large-scale Multimedia Event Detection (MED) and Multimedia Event Captioning (MEC) in zero-shot setting. More specifically, our framework composes the following: (1) deriving the novel semantic representations of events from their textual descriptions, rather than event names; (2) aggregating the ranks of grounded concepts for MED tasks. A statistical mean-shift outlier rejection model is proposed to remove the outlying concepts which are incorrectly grounded; and (3) defining MEC tasks and augmenting the MEC training set by the videos detected in MED in a zero-shot setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first time to define and solve the MEC task, which is a further step towards understanding video events.

Due to the principle of ternary closures and the trend of group formation, the multivariate relationships in social networks are complex and rich. Therefore, in graph learning tasks of social networks, the identification and utilization of multivariate relationship information are more important. Existing graph learning methods are based on the neighborhood information diffusion mechanism, which often leads to partial omission or even lack of multivariate relationship information, and ultimately affects the accuracy and execution efficiency of the task. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the multivariate relationship aggregation learning (MORE) method, which can effectively capture the multivariate relationship information in the network environment. By aggregating node attribute features and structural features, MORE achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. We conducted experiments on one citation network and five social networks. The experimental results show that the MORE model has higher accuracy than the GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) model in node classification tasks, and can significantly reduce time cost.","tags":["Time Series","Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Multivariate Relations Aggregation Learning in Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sheng Wan","Ping Zhong","Shirui Pan","Jian Yang","Guangyu Li","Chen Gong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587859200,"objectID":"31d662c6e9d8d0c37e40bba619bfe36b","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tgrs-2020-wan/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T12:15:49.437666Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tgrs-2020-wan/","section":"publication","summary":"In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, spatial context has demonstrated its significance in achieving promising performance. However, conventional spatial context-based methods simply assume that spatially neighboring pixels should correspond to the same land-cover class, so they often fail to correctly discover the contextual relations among pixels in complex situations, and thus leading to imperfect classification results on some irregular or inhomogeneous regions such as class boundaries. To address this deficiency, we develop a new HSI classification method based on the recently proposed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), as it can flexibly encode the relations among arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data. Different from traditional GCN, there are two novel strategies adopted by our method to further exploit the contextual relations for accurate HSI classification. First, since the receptive field of traditional GCN is often limited to fairly small neighborhood, we proposed to capture long range contextual relations in HSI by performing successive graph convolutions on a learned region-induced graph which is transformed from the original 2D image grids. Second, we refine the graph edge weight and the connective relationships among image regions simultaneously by learning the improved similarity measurement and the ‘edge filter’, so that the graph can be gradually refined to adapt to the representations generated by each graph convolutional layer. Such updated graph will in turn result in faithful region representations, and vice versa. The experiments carried out on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification with Context-aware Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Yuan","Xiaofei Zhou","Shirui Pan","Qiannan Zhu","Zeliang Song","Li Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587340800,"objectID":"285e33084b7a5a613e4ec835427543cc","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/ijcai-2020-yuan/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T12:15:49.436331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcai-2020-yuan/","section":"publication","summary":"Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in natural language processing (NLP), which aims to capture all relational triplets from plain texts.

However, increasing research has found that there is no positive correlation between the above validation accuracy and test accuracy for these One-Shot NAS methods, and this reward based sampling for supernet training also entails the rich-get-richer problem. To handle this deceptive problem, this paper presents a new approach, Efficient Novelty-driven Neural Architecture Search (EN2AS), to sample the most abnormal architecture to train the supernet.

In order to deal with the situation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework to learn chains of reasoning from a Knowledge Graph automatically. Our framework is inspired by the hierarchical structure through which human handle cognitionally ambiguous cases. The whole reasoning process is decomposed into a hierarchy of two-level Reinforcement Learning policies for encoding historical information and learning structured action space.

However, the presence of noisy facts in automatically extracted or crowdsourcing KGs significantly reduces the reliability of various embedding learners. In this paper, we thoroughly study the underlying reasons for the performance drop in dealing with noisy knowledge graphs, and we propose an ensemble framework, Adaptive Knowledge Subgraph Ensemble (AKSE), to enhance the robustness and trust of knowledge graph completion. By employing an effective knowledge subgraph extraction approach to re-sample the sub-components from the original knowledge graph, AKSE generates different representations for learning diversified base learners (e.g., TransE and DistMult), which substantially alleviates the noise effect of KG embedding. All embedding learners are integrated into a unified framework to reduce generalization errors via our simple or adaptive weighting schemes, where the weight is allocated based on each individual learner’s prediction capacity. Experimental results show that the robustness of our ensemble framework outperforms exiting knowledge graph embedding approaches on manually injected noise as well as inherent noisy extracted KGs.","tags":["Knowledge graph","graph embedding"],"title":"Adaptive knowledge subgraph ensemble for robust and trustworthy knowledge graph completion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jionghao Lin","Shirui Pan","Cheng Siong Lee","Sharon Oviatt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"e305b298adfb6aefed4edabe85e02ede","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/cikm-19-lin/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T12:19:12.827665Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cikm-19-lin/","section":"publication","summary":"Affective computing is an emerging research area which provides insights on human’s mental state through human-machine interaction.

On the one hand, data from other domains are often useful to improve the learning on the target domain; on the other hand, domain variance and hierarchical structure of documents from words, key phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. make it difficult to align domains for effective learning. To date, existing cross-domain text classification methods mainly strive to minimize feature distribution differences between domains, and they typically suffer from three major limitations — (1) difficult to capture semantics in non-consecutive phrases and long-distance word dependency because of treating texts as word sequences, (2) neglect of hierarchical coarse-grained structures of document for feature learning, and (3) narrow focus of the domains at instance levels, without using domains as supervisions to improve text classification. This paper proposes an end-to-end, domain-adversarial graph neural networks (DAGNN), for cross-domain text classification. Our motivation is to model documents as graphs and use a domain-adversarial training principle to lean features from each graph (as well as learning the separation of domains) for effective text classification. At the instance level, DAGNN uses a graph to model each document, so that it can capture non-consecutive and long-distance semantics. At the feature level, DAGNN uses graphs from different domains to jointly train hierarchical graph neural networks in order to learn good features. At the learning level, DAGNN proposes a domain-adversarial principle such that the learned features not only optimally classify documents but also separates domains.

In this article, we present a novel adversarially regularized framework for graph embedding. By employing the graph convolutional network as an encoder, our framework embeds the topological information and node content into a vector representation, from which a graph decoder is further built to reconstruct the input graph. The adversarial training principle is applied to enforce our latent codes to match a prior Gaussian or uniform distribution. Based on this framework, we derive two variants of the adversarial models, the adversarially regularized graph autoencoder (ARGA) and its variational version, and adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder (ARVGA), to learn the graph embedding effectively. We also exploit other potential variations of ARGA and ARVGA to get a deeper understanding of our designs.

To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel long-short distance aggregation networks (LSDAN) for positive unlabeled (PU) graph learning. Our theme is to generate multiple graphs at different distances based on the adjacency matrix, and further develop a long-short distance attention model for these graphs. The short-distance attention mechanism is used to capture the importance of neighbor nodes to a target node. The long-distance attention mechanism is used to capture the propagation of information within a localized area of each node and help model weights of different graphs for node representation learning.

Existing works on modeling heterogeneous graphs usually follow the idea of splitting a heterogeneous graph into multiple homogeneous subgraphs. This is ineffective in exploiting hidden rich semantic associations between different types of edges for large-scale multi-relational graphs. In this paper, we propose Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RSHN), a unified model that integrates graph and its coarsened line graph to embed both nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs without requiring any prior knowledge such as meta-path. To tackle the heterogeneity of edge connections, RSHN first creates a Coarsened Line Graph Neural Network (CL-GNN) to excavate edge-centric relation structural features that respect the latent associations of different types of edges based on coarsened line graph. After that, a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (H-GNN) is used to leverage implicit messages from neighbor nodes and edges propagating among nodes in heterogeneous graphs. As a result, different types of nodes and edges can enhance their embedding through mutual integration and promotion. Experiments and comparisons, based on semi-supervised classification tasks on large scale heterogeneous networks with over a hundred types of edges, show that RSHN significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Xiong","Weihan Shen","Hongshu Chen","Shirui Pan","Ximeng Wang","Zheng Yan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"6807559a6be454b3d29deba5a46b7b38","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tcyb-2019-xiong/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T12:21:15.618572Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tcyb-2019-xiong/","section":"publication","summary":"Social recommender systems have attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry. On social media, users’ ratings and reviews can be observed by all users, and have implicit influence on their future ratings. When these users make subsequent decisions about an item, they may be affected by existing ratings on the item. Thus, implicit influence propagates among the users who rated the same items, and it has significant impact on users’ ratings. However, implicit influence propagation and its effect on recommendation rarely have been studied. In this paper, we propose an information propagation-based social recommendation method (SoInp) and model the implicit user influence from the perspective of information propagation. The implicit influence is inferred from ratings on the same items. We investigate the concrete effect of implicit user influence in the propagation process and introduce it into recommender systems.

In this paper, we propose a goal-directed deep learning approach, Deep Attentional Embedded Graph Clustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an attention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a target node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels from the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training graph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering results. The self-training process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding in a unified framework, to mutually benefit both components.

Existing approaches mostly capture the spatial dependency on a fixed graph structure, assuming that the underlying relation between entities is pre-determined.

Furthermore, existing methods are ineffective to capture the temporal trends as the RNNs or CNNs employed in these methods cannot capture long-range temporal sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a novel graph neural network architecture, Graph WaveNet, for spatial-temporal graph modeling. By developing a novel adaptive dependency matrix and learn it through node embedding, our model can precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in the data. With a stacked dilated 1D convolution component whose receptive field grows exponentially as the number of layers increases, Graph WaveNet is able to handle very long sequences.

To date, although co-clustering has been commonly used for finding clusters for both instances and features, all existing methods are focused on instance-feature values, without leveraging valuable topology relationships between instances to help boost co-clustering performance. In this paper, we propose CFOND, a consensus factorization based framework for co-clustering networked data. We argue that feature values and linkages provide useful information from different perspectives, yet they are not always consistent and therefore need to be carefully aligned for best clustering results. In the paper, we advocate a consensus factorization principle, which simultaneously factorizes information from three aspects: network topology structures, instance-feature content relationships, and feature-feature correlations. The consensus factorization ensures that the final cluster structures are consistent across information from the three aspects with minimum errors.

Conventional machine learning methods require a large amount of individual data to be collected from users’ Internet activities, smart phones and wearable healthcare devices, to amass them in a central location. The centralized setting arises significant privacy and data misuse concerns, especially where vulnerable people are concerned. To address this problem, we propose a novel data-protecting solution to learn a model. Instead of asking users to share all their personal data, our solution is to train a local data-preserving model for each user which only shares their own model’s parameters with the server rather than their personal information.

To enhance the label relatedness captured by the embeddings, multiple contexts can be adopted. However, these contexts are heterogeneous and often partially observed in practical tasks, imposing significant challenges to capture the overall relatedness among labels. In this paper, we propose a general Partial Heterogeneous Context Label Embedding (PHCLE) framework to address these challenges. Categorizing heterogeneous contexts into two groups, relational context and descriptive context, we design tailor-made matrix factorization formula to effectively exploit the label relatedness in each context. With a shared embedding principle across heterogeneous contexts, the label relatedness is selectively aligned in a shared space. Due to our elegant formulation, PHCLE overcomes the partial context problem and can nicely incorporate more contexts, which both cannot be tackled with existing multi-context label embedding methods. An effective alternative optimization algorithm is further derived to solve the sparse matrix factorization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the label embeddings obtained with PHCLE achieve superb performance in image classification task and exhibit good interpretability in the downstream label similarity analysis and image understanding task.","tags":["Label embedding"],"title":"Label Embedding with Partial Heterogeneous Contexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuanyuan Cai","Shirui Pan","Ximeng Wang","Hongshu Chen","Xiaoyan Cai","Min Zuo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"08343417aa75f4b522a13307329a58e5","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/cai-measuring-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.67125Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cai-measuring-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The assessment of semantic similarity between lexical terms plays a critical part in semantic-oriented applications for natural language processing and cognitive science. The optimization of calculation models is still a challenging issue for improving the performance of similarity measurement. In this paper, we investigate WordNet-based measures including distance-based, information-based, feature-based and hybrid. Among them, the distance-based measures are considered to have the lowest computational complexity due to simple distance calculation. However, most of existing works ignore the meronymy relation between concepts and the non-uniformity of path distances caused by various semantic relations, in which path distances are simply determined by conceptual hyponymy relation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model to calculate the path distance between concepts, and also propose a similarity measure which nonlinearly transforms the distance to semantic similarity. In the proposed model, we assign different weights in accordance with various relations to edges that link different concepts. On basis of the distance model, we use five structure properties of WordNet for similarity measurement, which consist of multiple meanings, multiple inheritance, link type, depth and local density. Our similarity measure is compared against state-of-the-art WordNet-based measures on M\u0026C dataset, R\u0026G dataset and WS-353 dataset. According to experiment results, the proposed measure in this work outperforms others in terms of both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, which indicates the effectiveness of our distance model.

Social recommendation models utilize social information to reveal the impact of neighbors on user preferences, and this impact is often described by the linear superposition of neighbor preferences or by global trust propagation. Further exploration needs to be undertaken to determine whether the influence pattern of other users from online interaction behaviors is adequately described. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary opinion dynamics from the field of statistical physics into recommender systems, characterizing the impact of other users. We propose an opinion dynamic model by evolutionary game theory. To describe online user interactions, we define the strategies during an interaction between two users, and present the payoff for each strategy in terms of errors of estimated ratings. Therefore, user behaviors are associated with their preferences and ratings. In addition, we measure user influence according to their topological roles in the social network. We incorporate evolutionary opinion dynamics and user influence into the recommendation framework for the prediction of unknown ratings. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art models in terms of accuracy, and it also performs well for cold-start users. Our method reduces the divergence of user preferences, in accordance with online opinion interactions. Furthermore, our method has approximate computational complexity with matrix factorization, and results in less computation than state-of-the-art models.

Complex data pose new challenges for current research in data mining and knowledge discovery as they require new methods for processing, mining, and learning them. Traditional data analysis methods often require the data to be represented as vectors [6].

Such a simple feature-vector representation inherently loses the structure information of the objects. In reality, objects may have complicated characteristics, depending on how the objects are assessed and characterized. Meanwhile, the data may come from heterogeneous domains [7], such as traditional tabular-based data, sequential patterns, graphs, time-series information, and semistructured data.

Graph stream classification aims to learn a classification model from a stream of graphs with only one-pass of data, requiring real-time processing in training and prediction. This is a nontrivial task, as many existing methods require multipass of the graph stream to extract subgraph structures as features for graph classification which does not simultaneously satisfy 'one-pass' and 'real-time' requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive real-time graph stream classification method to address this challenge. We partition the unbounded graph stream data into consecutive graph chunks, each consisting of a fixed number of graphs and delivering a corresponding chunk-level classifier. We employ a random hashing function to compress the original node set of graphs in each chunk for fast feature detection when training chunk-level classifiers. Furthermore, a differential hashing strategy is applied to map unlimited increasing features (i.e., cliques) into a fixed-size feature space which is then used as a feature vector for stochastic learning. Finally, the chunk-level classifiers are weighted in an ensemble learning model for graph classification. The proposed method substantially speeds up the graph feature extraction and avoids unbounded graph feature growth. Moreover, it effectively offsets concept drifts in graph stream classification.

As a result, it is difficult to guarantee the distinguishing capacity of the selected instances in the new bag mapping space. In this paper, we propose a discriminative mapping approach for multi-instance learning (MILDM) that aims to identify the best instances to directly distinguish bags in the new mapping space. Accordingly, each instance bag can be mapped using the selected instances to a new feature space, and hence any generic learning algorithm, such as an instance-based learning algorithm, can be used to derive learning models for multi-instance classification. Experiments and comparisons on eight different types of real-world learning tasks (including 14 data sets) demonstrate that MILDM outperforms the state-of-The-Art bag mapping multi-instance learning approaches.

This inherently limits its use to the classification of complicated objects containing complex structures and uncertain labels. In this paper, we advance graph classification to handle multigraph learning for complicated objects from multiple structure views, where each object is represented as a bag containing several graphs and the label is only available for each graph bag but not individual graphs inside the bag. To learn such graph classification models, we propose a multistructure-view bag constrained learning (MSVBL) algorithm, which aims to explore substructure features across multiple structure views for learning. By enabling joint regularization across multiple structure views and enforcing labeling constraints at the bag and graph levels, MSVBL is able to discover the most effective substructure features across all structure views. Experiments and comparisons on real-world data sets validate and demonstrate the superior performance of MSVBL in representing complicated objects as multigraph for classification, e.g., MSVBL outperforms the state-of-the-art multiview graph classification and multiview multi-instance learning approaches.","tags":["Graph","graph classification","multiview learning","subgraph mining"],"title":"Multiple structure-view learning for graph classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Libin Yang","Yu Zheng","Xiaoyan Cai","Shirui Pan","Tao Dai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"78a3140a79dc2579724a101e4b35dea7","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/yang-query-oriented-2018/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.688019Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-query-oriented-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid proliferation of information technology, researchers find it more and more difficult to rapidly find appropriate reference papers for an authoring paper.

In this paper, we study a new universum graph classification framework which leverages additional “non-example” graphs to help improve the graph classification accuracy. We argue that although universum graphs do not belong to the target class, they may contain meaningful structure patterns to help enrich the feature space for graph representation and classification. To support universum graph classification, we propose a mathematical programming algorithm, ugBoost, which integrates discriminative subgraph selection and margin maximization into a unified framework to fully exploit the universum. Because informative subgraph exploration in a universum setting requires the search of a large space, we derive an upper bound discriminative score for each subgraph and employ a branch-and-bound scheme to prune the search space. By using the explored subgraphs, our graph classification model intends to maximize the margin between positive and negative graphs and minimize the loss on the universum graph examples simultaneously. The subgraph exploration and the learning are integrated and performed iteratively so that each can be beneficial to the other.

The feature learning and the multiple task learning are iteratively optimized to form a multitask graph classification model with a global optimization goal.

In this paper we study the problem of classifying networked text data with only positive and unlabeled examples available. We present a non-negative matrix factorization-based approach to networked text classification by factorizing content matrix of the nodes and topological network structures, and by incorporating supervised information into the learning of objective function via a consensus principle. We propose a novel learning algorithm, namely puNet (positive and unlabeled learning algorithm for Networked text data), for efficiently classifying networked text, even if training datasets contain only a small amount of positive examples and a large amount of unlabeled ones.

In this paper, we argue that due to unique characteristics of enterprise social networks, simple clustering for ESN nodes or using existing topic discovery methods cannot effectively discover functional groups and understand their roles. Alternatively, we propose CENFLD, which carries out co-clustering on enterprise social networks for functional group discovery and understanding. CENFLD is a co-factorization based framework which combines network topology structures and rich content information, including interactions between nodes and correlations between node content, to discover functional user groups. Because the number of functional groups is highly data driven and hard to estimate, CENFLD employs a hold-out test principle to find the group number optimally complying with the underlying data.

Such a multi-graph representation can be used for many real-world applications, such as webpage classification, where a webpage can be regarded as a bag with texts and images inside the webpage being represented as graphs.

Given a set of labeled multi-graph bags, bMGC employs dynamic weight adjustment at both bag- and graph-levels to select one subgraph in each iteration as a weak classifier. In each iteration, bag and graph weights are adjusted such that an incorrectly classified bag will receive a higher weight because its predicted bag label conflicts to the genuine label, whereas an incorrectly classified graph will receive a lower weight value if the graph is in a positive bag (or a higher weight if the graph is in a negative bag). Accordingly, bMGC is able to differentiate graphs in positive and negative bags to derive effective classifiers to form a boosting model for MGC.

Although cost-sensitive learning has been extensively studied, all methods are based on data with instance-feature representation. Graphs, however, do not have features available for learning and the feature space of graph data is likely infinite and needs to be carefully explored in order to favor classes with a higher cost. In this paper, we propose, CogBoost, a fast cost-sensitive graph classification algorithm, which aims to minimize the misclassification costs (instead of the errors) and achieve fast learning speed for large scale graph data sets. To minimize the misclassification costs, CogBoost iteratively selects the most discriminative subgraph by considering costs of different classes, and then solves a linear programming problem in each iteration by using Bayes decision rule based optimal loss function. In addition, a cutting plane algorithm is derived to speed up the solving of linear programs for fast learning on large scale data sets.

Due to the lack of explicit features to represent graphs for training classification models, extensive studies have been focused on extracting the most discriminative subgraphs features from the training graph dataset to transfer graphs into vector data. However, such filter-based methods suffer from two major disadvantages: (1) the subgraph feature selection is separated from the model learning process, so the selected most discriminative subgraphs may not best fit the subsequent learning model, resulting in deteriorated classification results; (2) all these methods rely on users to specify the number of subgraph features K, and suboptimally specified K values often result in significantly reduced classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new graph classification paradigm which overcomes the above disadvantages by formulating subgraph feature selection as learning a K-dimensional feature space from an implicit and large subgraph space, with the optimal K value being automatically determined. To achieve the goal, we propose a regularized loss minimization-driven (RLMD) feature selection method for graph classification. RLMD integrates subgraph selection and model learning into a unified framework to find discriminative subgraphs with guaranteed minimum loss w.r.t. the objective function. To automatically determine the optimal number of subgraphs K from the exponentially large subgraph space, an effective elastic net and a subgradient method are proposed to derive the stopping criterion, so that K can be automatically obtained once RLMD converges. The proposed RLMD method enjoys gratifying property including proved convergence and applicability to various loss functions.

This problem is further complicated with the presence of noise, because they are similar to minority samples and any treatment for the class imbalance may falsely focus on the noise and result in deterioration of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a classification model to tackle imbalanced graph streams with noise. Our method, graph ensemble boosting, employs an ensemble-based framework to partition graph stream into chunks each containing a number of noisy graphs with imbalanced class distributions. For each individual chunk, we propose a boosting algorithm to combine discriminative subgraph pattern selection and model learning as a unified framework for graph classification. To tackle concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the boosting framework can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification.

And this type of approach has been proved to achieve good performance for naive Bayes, a BNC with simple structure. However, we do not know whether or how effective it works for improving the performance of the complex BNC. In this paper, we first do a survey on the complex structure models for BNCs and their improvements, then carry out a systematically experimental analysis to investigate the effectiveness of locally weighted method for complex BNCs, e.g., tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN), averaged one-dependence estimators AODE and hidden naive Bayes (HNB), measured by classification accuracy (ACC) and the area under the ROC curve ranking (AUC). Experiments and comparisons on 36 benchmark data sets collected from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in Weka system demonstrate that locally weighting technologies just slightly outperforms unweighted complex BNCs on ACC and AUC. In other words, although locally weighting could significantly improve the performance of NB (a BNC with simple structure), it could not work well on BNCs with complex structures.

In many applications, it is common to have useful information from different channels/views to describe objects, which naturally results in a new representation with multiple graphs generated from different feature views being used to describe one object. In this paper, we formulate a new Multi-Graph-View learning task for graph classification, where each object to be classified contains graphs from multiple graph-views. This problem setting is essentially different from traditional single-graph-view graph classification, where graphs are from one single feature view. To solve the problem, we propose a Cross Graph-View Sub graph Feature based Learning (gCGVFL) algorithm that explores an optimal set of sub graphs, across multiple graph-views, as features to represent graphs. Specifically, we derive an evaluation criterion to estimate the discriminative power and the redundancy of sub graph features across all views, and assign proper weight values to each view to indicate its importance for graph classification. The iterative cross graph-view sub graph scoring and graph-view weight updating form a closed loop to find optimal sub graphs to represent graphs for multi-graph-view learning.

In reality, the pronounced advantage of NB is often challenged by the strong conditional independence assumption between attributes, which may deteriorate the classification performance. Accordingly, numerous efforts have been made to improve NB, by using approaches such as structure extension, attribute selection, attribute weighting, instance weighting, local learning and so on. In this paper, we propose a new Artificial Immune System (AIS) based self-adaptive attribute weighting method for Naive Bayes classification. The proposed method, namely AISWNB, uses immunity theory in Artificial Immune Systems to search optimal attribute weight values, where self-adjusted weight values will alleviate the conditional independence assumption and help calculate the conditional probability in an accurate way. One noticeable advantage of AISWNB is that the unique immune system based evolutionary computation process, including initialization, clone, section, and mutation, ensures that AISWNB can adjust itself to the data without explicit specification of functional or distributional forms of the underlying model. As a result, AISWNB can obtain good attribute weight values during the learning process. Experiments and comparisons on 36 machine learning benchmark data sets and six image classification data sets demonstrate that AISWNB significantly outperforms its peers in classification accuracy, class probability estimation, and class ranking performance.","tags":["Attribute weighting","Artificial Immune Systems","Evolutionary computing","Naive Bayes Self-adaptive"],"title":"Self-adaptive attribute weighting for Naive Bayes classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jia Wu","Zhihua Cai","Shirui Pan","Xingquan Zhu","Chengqi Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"af15ac683dc03ebdca4d677c8b1a0754","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/wu-attribute-2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.705835Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-attribute-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"A Bayesian Network (BN) is a graphical model which can be used to represent conditional dependency between random variables, such as diseases and symptoms. A Bayesian Network Classifier (BNC) uses BN to characterize the relationships between attributes and the class labels, where a simplified approach is to employ a conditional independence assumption between attributes and the corresponding class labels, i.e., the Naive Bayes (NB) classification model. One major approach to mitigate NB's primary weakness (the conditional independence assumption) is the attribute weighting, and this type of approach has been proved to be effective for NB with simple structure. However, for weighted BNCs involving complex structures, in which attribute weighting is embedded into the model, there is no existing study on whether the weighting will work for complex BNCs and how effective it will impact on the learning of a given task. In this paper, we first survey several complex structure models for BNCs, and then carry out experimental studies to investigate the effectiveness of the attribute weighting strategies for complex BNCs, with a focus on Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) and Averaged One-Dependence Estimation (AODE). Our studies use classification accuracy (ACC), area under the ROC curve ranking (AUC), and conditional log likelihood (CLL), as the performance metrics.

In this paper, we formulate a new cross-view feature selection problem that aims to identify the most representative features across all feature views for MIL. To achieve the goal, we design a new optimization problem by integrating both multiview representation and multi-instance bag constraints.

The wide spread of the graph applications and the inherent complex relationships between graph objects have made the labels of the graph data expensive and/or difficult to obtain, especially for applications involving dynamic changing graph records. While labeled graphs are limited, the copious amounts of unlabeled graphs are often easy to obtain with trivial efforts. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a stream based graph classification model by combining both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Our method, called gSLU, employs an ensemble based framework to partition graph streams into a number of graph chunks each containing some labeled and unlabeled graphs. For each individual chunk, we propose a minimum-redundancy subgraph feature selection module to select a set of informative subgraph features to build a classifier. To tackle the concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the subgraph feature selection can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification. Experiments on real-world graph streams demonstrate clear benefits of using minimum-redundancy subgraph features to build accurate classifiers.
